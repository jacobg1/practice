3) Whisk eggs, milk, honey, and kosher salt until eggs are no longer visible.

4) Dip your bread slices in the custard. If you're using a pre-sliced loaf and the slices are thin, a short dip (just enough to coat both sides) should be enough. However, if your slices are thick, you may want to give the bread a minute or two to soak up the custard.

5) Transfer the slices to your frying pan and cook on a medium-low heat until brown on the bottom.
